ASP.NET Core can be used similarly to Spring for full Web application to Spring. It's built on
top of DotNet, meaning you don't have to use C#, but you probably will. It's the defacto web 
framework for DotNet developers. 

When running the application, there is a similar format as Spring as well. A builder is used to
create the app which includes the underlying code for running a web server.
